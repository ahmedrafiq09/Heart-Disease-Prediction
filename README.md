## Heart Disease Prediction Model using Random Forest

This repository contains code for a machine learning model built to predict the likelihood of heart disease using the Random Forest algorithm. The model utilizes data preprocessing techniques, including Label Encoding, to convert categorical string values into integers for better compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

### Model Overview

The heart disease prediction model aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease based on various health-related attributes. The Random Forest algorithm, known for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets, is employed for its predictive capabilities.

### Data Preprocessing

To prepare the data for training the model, the following preprocessing steps are implemented:

- **Label Encoding:** Certain categorical features are encoded into numerical values using Label Encoder. This conversion ensures that the categorical data can be effectively utilized by the Random Forest algorithm.

### Model Training and Evaluation

Once the data preprocessing is complete, the Random Forest classifier is trained on the preprocessed dataset. The model is then evaluated using appropriate performance metrics to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Usage

To utilize the heart disease prediction model:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the README to preprocess the data and train the model.
4. Evaluate the trained model's performance using the provided metrics.
5. Integrate the model into your applications or workflows for heart disease prediction.
